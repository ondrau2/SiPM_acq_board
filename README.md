Title: Compact multi-channel analyzer for SiPM detectors with real time on-board signal analysis

Most of the commercially available MCAs for SiPM detectors provide precision spectral measurements with costly high-end components. These devices are ideal for accurate instrumentation, however the high complexity makes these devices costly and thus unavailable to wider public. 

The main idea of the presented device is to develop a low-cost MCA which uses widely available of-the-shelf components while providing a spectroscopy of gamma particles with reasonable resolution. The device is based on a STM32G4 family microcontroller, which comprises precision timers with sub-nanosecond resolution, internal embedded analog amplifiers, comparators and up to 4MHz ADC. This significantly reduces required number of external components lowering price and increasing reliability. 

The measurement can be configured by user and may use up to three simultaneous ToT measurements with configurable threshold levels, pulse height measurement, or combination of both. The pulse approximation based on the measured parameters can also be performed to provide peak area measurement. Results can be acquired using various connectivity possibilities such as USB, Ethernet or WiFi. Thanks to the server running on the device the measurement information can be accessed from an internet browser. With an on-board bias power supply only an external power adapter and a SiPM detector with scintillator is needed for measurement.
